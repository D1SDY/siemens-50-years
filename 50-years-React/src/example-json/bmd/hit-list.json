"description":"Minerals is responsible for supplying the mining and cement industries with products, systems, solutions (incl. modernization/upgrades) and services (incl. product retrofits of motors and drives) along the complete production chain from extraction of raw material through multiple processing stages to transportation and stockpiling of end product. Minerals specific applications and bespoke solutions are provided to end customers (miners, plant operators) as well as to OEMs and EPCs in the mining and cement industry. The Minerals portfolio encompasses electrification, automation and digitalization (EAD) of core production and secondary processes ranging from system solutions right up to completely integrated electrical installations in the role of MEV, MEAV or E-EPC.  Main focus of portfolio is to provide unique value-add to customers by seamless integration of innovative EAD solutions along the entire production chain. Starting from basic field level through process automation up to MES and MOM software solutions across multiple production sites, these integrated EAD solutions increase transparency, productivity and reliability of operations from pit to port. Also covered are secondary processes like production logistics, IT&C infrastructure and ELV systems. Under certain circumstances Minerals provides specific solutions involving process technology, such as sensor-based material sorting or advanced-process-control, as well as complete lifecycle services via internal partner CS throughout the operational phase. Minerals has particular expertise with heavy-duty drive train applications and integrated drive system solutions (IDS) in mining and cement industry based on customer specifications. The landscape of integrated drive system solutions currently comprises heavy mining equipment e.g. for excavators, mine winders, bucket wheelers, shovels (but excluding mobile mining equipment like trucks or trolley systems), bulk material handling including stackers, reclaimers, shiploaders and conveyors (incl. underground conveyors) mainly in the range >200kW, as well as integrated drive system solutions for the comminution process area like crushers, gearless drives for mills, conventional grinding mills >2MW, HPGR and Verti-mills. Integrated drive system solutions for secondary processes like process water pumps, fans and compressors. Depending on the specific case it can be agreed that the responsibility for particular IDS applications lies within PD MD AP (e.g. Multi-Drive). Heavy Duty Rectifier systems and solutions for electrochemical electrolysis applications for, but not limited to, non-ferrous metals (Copper, Zinc, Nickel, Aluminium, Magnesium) and Graphitization for new plant installations as well as expansion projects and modernizations.  Overall lead responsibility for definition and market positioning within the mining and cement industry. Business Unit function comprises global marketing and sales support to regions as well as consulting, planning, development and execution with internal (i.e. OEC for projects, CS for lifecycle services, EM for energy solutions) and external partners.",
